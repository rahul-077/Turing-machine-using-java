# Turing-machine-using-java

Objective:
Designing a turing machine in a java compiler inorder to operate the basic operations of a
turing machine i.e 1)Reading the symbol on the tape under the head. 2)Edit the symbol by
writing a new symbol or erasing it. 3)Move the tape left or right by one square so that the
machine can read(compare) and edit the symbol on a neighbouring cell of the tape.
In the given Documentation, we had tried to create a Turing Machine which is able to
compare any two binary strings and provide the Output that input is Accepted or not using
the fundamentals of Turing machine.
